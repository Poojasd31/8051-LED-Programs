This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking program using the 8051 microcontroller.
It is often the very first program beginners write when learning embedded systems, as it introduces:

GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) handling
Delay generation
Basic microcontroller programming concepts

⚙️ Hardware Requirements

8051 Microcontroller (AT89C51/AT89S52)
LED
Current limiting resistor (220Ω – 1kΩ)
Development board
Power supply (5V DC)

🖥️ Software Requirements
Keil µVision IDE
Proteus 
Flash Programmer tool- ISP-ICP Nuovoton Utility
